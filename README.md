## Project Introduction

SafeGuard Home AI aims to improve the safety and independence of the elderly by using AI and smart home technology to detect falls in real-time, ensuring instant notification to caregivers or emergency contacts. This project addresses the increasing fall death rate among adults aged 65 and older and seeks to provide a non-intrusive, privacy-respecting solution that integrates seamlessly into the lives of its users.

## Research Challenges

Our research focuses on creating a reliable system that:
- Accurately distinguishes falls from normal activities to minimize false alarms.
- Respects user privacy and dignity.
- Offers an easy-to-use experience for elderly individuals and their caregivers.

## Hypothesis

We hypothesize that SafeGuard Home AI will accurately detect falls within the home environment in real-time, reducing the consequences of falls through immediate notifications to caregivers or emergency contacts, while prioritizing user privacy and delivering a seamless experience.

## Importance of the Project

The project addresses the critical need for enhanced safety and independence of the elderly, leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. It aims to provide peace of mind to families, ensure privacy, and empower the elderly to live confidently in their own homes.

## Target Audience

1. Elderly individuals or those with mobility issues seeking to make their homes safer.
2. Caregivers or family members looking for a reliable system to monitor their loved ones remotely.
